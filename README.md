The name Arbor-AI, under the rustic-ml organization, elegantly captures the essence of a machine learning and artificial intelligence project. Derived from the Latin word for "tree," Arbor symbolizes the branching structures of knowledge, mirroring tree-based algorithms like decision trees or random forests, or the hierarchical frameworks often found in AI systems. It evokes organic growth, interconnected ideas, and simplicity, aligning with rustic-ml's potential focus on accessible, lightweight ML tools. Paired with AI, the name underscores a commitment to advancing intelligent systems, making Arbor-AI a fitting emblem for a project that cultivates innovative, collaborative, and robust AI solutions.

ArborAI: Rust-Powered Stock OHLCV Prediction
Overview
ArborAI is a high-performance, Rust-based machine learning project designed to predict stock OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data using decision tree-based ensemble algorithms. Leveraging Rust’s speed and safety, ArborAI integrates XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, and CatBoost (via Rust bindings or compatible libraries) to deliver accurate, scalable predictions for trading and investment strategies. By combining historical price data, technical indicators, and ensemble methods, ArborAI empowers users to optimize trading decisions and market analysis.
Features

Rust Implementation: Built with Rust for blazing-fast performance and memory safety.
Ensemble Algorithms: Utilizes XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, and CatBoost for robust OHLCV predictions.
Feature Engineering: Incorporates lagged OHLCV, technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, SMA), and volume metrics.
Applications: Supports trading strategy development, portfolio optimization, and risk assessment.

Algorithms and Their Capabilities

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):

Description: A gradient-boosting framework that builds decision trees sequentially, optimizing loss with regularization.
Stock Data Use: Predicts OHLCV values or price direction (up/down) by capturing non-linear patterns in historical data and technical indicators.
Capabilities: High accuracy for regression (OHLCV prediction) and classification (trend prediction); excels in structured data like stock prices.


LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine):

Description: A histogram-based gradient-boosting algorithm with leaf-wise tree growth for faster training and lower memory usage.
Stock Data Use: Efficiently forecasts OHLCV for large datasets (e.g., high-frequency trading data) with minimal computational resources.
Capabilities: Scales to millions of data points; ideal for real-time or high-frequency stock predictions.


AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting):

Description: Boosts weak decision trees by iteratively weighting misclassified instances to improve accuracy.
Stock Data Use: Predicts price movements or classifies market regimes (bull/bear) using simpler models.
Capabilities: Effective for baseline models or when interpretability is prioritized; less complex than XGBoost/LightGBM.


CatBoost (Categorical Boosting):

Description: A gradient-boosting algorithm optimized for categorical features with ordered boosting to reduce overfitting.
Stock Data Use: Handles categorical inputs (e.g., market sectors, trading sessions) and predicts OHLCV with high generalization.
Capabilities: Robust to noisy stock data; improves accuracy for datasets with categorical or sparse features.



Benefits for Users

Accuracy and Speed: Rust’s performance, combined with optimized algorithms, delivers fast, precise OHLCV predictions, enabling real-time trading decisions.
Scalability: Handles large datasets (e.g., years of minute-level data), making it suitable for institutional and retail traders.
Versatility: Supports diverse use cases, from short-term day trading to long-term portfolio optimization.
Reliability: Rust’s memory safety minimizes runtime errors, ensuring stable execution for critical financial applications.
Actionable Insights: Feature importance rankings from models help users identify key drivers of stock price movements.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ArborAI.git
cd ArborAI


Install Rust (if not already installed):curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
